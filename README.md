# DarkSkyPy
A Different Python3 wrapper for the [DarkSky.net](https://www.darksky.net) API.

Rewriting the API to reduce clutter and make obtaining data much more flexible. Based heavily off David Ervideira's forecastiopy.

Safe to assume this API is broken, please use [forecastiopy](https://github.com/dvdme/forecastiopy) (python2.7) or  [forecastiopy3](https://github.com/bitpixdigital/forecastiopy3) (python3) if you actually need an API
